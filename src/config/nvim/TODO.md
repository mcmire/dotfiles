# TODO

## Higher priority

- Fix auto-pairs logic so it works like old `auto-pairs` plugin
  - Maybe it's as simple as, if I touch a word character then stop the auto-pair
- Add Copilot NES
- Make Copilot easily toggleable
- How do I scroll down in documentation hover popup?

## Medium priority

- TypeScript hover floating window doesn't look as good as Lua
  - Maybe I can follow this: <https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-lsp-hover-borders/>
- Update configuration files without needing to restart
- Add a new plugin without needing to restart

## Nice to have

- Replace status line, as the left icon jumps around in insert mode
  - Maybe lualine?
- Cool plugins maybe worth adding:
  - `stevearc/aerial.nvim`
